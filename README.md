# Color-Randomizer

Transitioning from cross-platform to native. This is my first attempt by sharing already known programming experiences from both dart and JavaScript to see if i can. 


# Disclaimer
This app is not intended to be visual appealing, Its an app made to test the capabilities of Swift coming from a background of different languages of expertise in an attempt to learn swift. Pardon the UI as i am focusing more on programming principles and concepts as well as state.
